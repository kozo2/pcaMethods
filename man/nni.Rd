\title{Nearest neighbour imputation}
\usage{
nni(object, method = c("llsImpute"), subset = numeric(), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Numerical matrix with (or an object coercible to
such) with samples in rows and variables as columns. Also takes
\code{ExpressionSet} in which case the transposed expression
matrix is used.}

\item{method}{For convenience one can pass a large matrix but only
use the variable specified as subset. Can be colnames or indices.}

\item{subset}{Currently "llsImpute" only.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to the chosen method.}
}
\value{
A \code{clusterRes} object. Or a list containing a
clusterRes object as first and an ExpressionSet object as second
entry if the input was of type ExpressionSet.
}
\description{
Wrapper function for imputation methods based on nearest neighbour
clustering. Currently llsImpute only.
}
\details{
This method is wrapper function to llsImpute, See documentation
for \code{link{llsImpute}}.

\examples{
data(metaboliteData)
llsRes <- nni(metaboliteData, k=6, method="llsImpute", allGenes=TRUE)
